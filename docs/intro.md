React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript, on top of powerful native primitives.

## Installation

If you're already familiar with React Native then you'll be able to get moving with React Navigation quickly! First, you will need to install the `react-navigation` package in your React Native project.

```bash
yarn add react-navigation
# or with npm
# npm install --save react-navigation
```

You're good to go! Continue to ["Getting Started"](getting-started.html) to start writing some code.

Sometimes we want to run side-effects when a screen is focused. A side effect may involve things like adding an event listener, fetching data, updating document title, etc. While this can be achieved using `focus` and `blur` events, it's not very ergonomic.

To make this easier, the library exports a `useFocusEffect` hook:

```js
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/core';

function Profile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  useFocusEffect(
    React.useCallback(() => {
      const unsubscribe = API.subscribe(userId, user => setUser(user));

      return () => unsubscribe();
    }, [userId])
  );

  return <ProfileContent user={user} />;
}
```

The `useFocusEffect` is analogous to React's `useEffect` hook. The only difference is that it runs on focus instead of render.

> Note: To avoid the running the effect too often, it's important to wrap the callback in `useCallback` before passing it to `useFocusEffect` as shown in the example.

## Delaying effect until transition finishes

The `useFocusEffect` hook runs the effect as soon as the screen comes into focus. This often means that if there is an animation for the screen change, it might not have finished yet.

React Navigation runs its animations in native thread, so it's not a problem in many cases. But if the effect updates the UI or renders something expensive, then it can affect the animation performance. In such cases, we can use [`InteractionManager`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/interactionmanager) to defer our work until the animations or gestures have finished:

```js
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    const task = InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {
      // Expensive task
    });

    return () => task.cancel();
  }, [])
);
```

## How is `useFocusEffect` different from adding a listener for `focus` event?

The `focus` event fires when a screen comes into focus. Since it's an event, your listener won't be called if the screen was already focused when you subscribed to the event. This also doesn't provide a way to perform a cleanup function when the screen becomes unfocused. You can subscribe to the `blur` event and handle it manually, but it can get messy. You will usually need to handle `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` as well in addition to these events, which complicates it even more.

The `useFocusEffect` allows you to run an effect on focus and clean it up when the screen becomes unfocused. It also handles cleanup on unmount. It re-runs the effect when dependencies change, so you don't need to worry about stale values in your listener.
